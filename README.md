this is my first attept at my journal, i had a bit of trouble getting back in to git and git hub, but after a few trial and errors i managed to get there in the end, my major issue was learning the branch command lines as im not use to doing them, my fist time branching, i did it wrong and brached the checkout instead of commiting it and then the next time i learned that to merge the 2 branches you need to checkout first
